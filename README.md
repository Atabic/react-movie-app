# Hi Aksa & Khurram
The following project was built in reactjs using CRA. I added all the features I could add in a day.

You can run this project by running the following command

### `npm run start`

### Features
* Genre can be selected multiple
* You can select a rating from dropdown
* You can select from Sorting Dropdwon (Defauly: Popularity)
* You can select multiple years (There's isn't any attribute that take array of years selected, so I have fetch data for each year and added that to movies page) Also this is not synced with everything else in filters and sorting
* Placeholder image for movies that has missing Image URL
